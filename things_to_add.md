# Features to add

## UI Enhancements

- Fix the extra space issue in the narrative.
- Possibly combine some of the sections together.
- Build new modalities for selection.
  - Consider adding dynamic sentences.
  - Drop downs to select multiple options, which leads to comma separated sentences.
  - Possible overlay panel for more complex selections.

## Features

- Signal/Note/Flag researchers can use to signal to the IRB Specialist that some special attention should be paid somewhere.
- Form-based approach (minimal context) which maps one to one to map between form and narrative -- capitalization, grammar, may need to be adjusted to make sense in a form.
